The mouse is nice & sturdy,4.0 out of 5 stars,Yash Mathukia,"The product is good & worth the money. The packing was little damaged due to delivery but the product was not damaged. The only problem with this Matte finish mouse is that despite your hands are clean, you will always feel the mouse is dusty because of the matte finish on the top of the mouse.",Reviewed in India ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ on 13 June 2023
9 Months Review,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pravin,"Guys, this is my 4th HP product and I see that nowadays HP products are very bad in quality. Having trouble in left click button, simply double clicks mostly for a single click and taking a snap with this mouse is a nightmare. Have to try atleast 3 times to capture the correct frame. Its been like this for 2 weeks, bought it on 25 Sep 2022. Should get a replacement and that's another headache, called a local HP authorised service centre the said we can do only with ticket number from HP customer care team, so called the toll free number they said no need ticket numbers for mouse. Confused!! ğŸ˜¢ğŸ˜¢",Reviewed in India ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ on 24 May 2023
